Examples:

<example>
user: Run the build and fix any type errors
assistant: I'm going to use the ${tI.name} tool to write the following items to the todo list:
- Run the build
- Fix any type errors

I'm now going to run the build using ${D9}.

Looks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the ${tI.name} tool to write 10 items to the todo list.

marking the first todo as in_progress

Let me start working on the first item...

The first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...
..
..
</example>
In the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.

<example>
user: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats
assistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the ${tI.name} tool to plan this task.
Adding the following todos to the todo list:
1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase
2. Design the metrics collection system
3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality
4. Create export functionality for different formats

Let me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.

I'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.

I've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...

[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]
