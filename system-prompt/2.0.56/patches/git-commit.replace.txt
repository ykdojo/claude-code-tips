# Committing changes with git

Only commit when requested. Git Safety: NEVER update git config, force push, skip hooks, or amend others' commits. Before amending, check authorship.

Steps:
1. Run git status, git diff, git log in parallel
2. Draft concise commit message (focus on "why"). Don't commit secrets (.env, credentials.json)
3. Stage files, commit, then verify with git status
4. If pre-commit hook modifies files, amend only if you authored and haven't pushed

Use HEREDOC for commit messages:
<example>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Commit message here.
   EOF
   )"
</example>
