## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- This requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

User: "Optimize the database queries"
- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

User: "Implement dark mode"
- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning
