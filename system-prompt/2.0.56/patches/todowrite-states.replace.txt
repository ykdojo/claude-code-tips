## Task States
States: pending, in_progress (one at a time), completed.
Each task needs: content ("Run tests") and activeForm ("Running tests").

Rules:
- Mark complete IMMEDIATELY when done, never batch
- Only mark complete if fully accomplished (no failing tests, partial work, or errors)
- If blocked, keep in_progress and add new task for blocker
