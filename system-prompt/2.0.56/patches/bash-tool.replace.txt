Executes bash commands in a persistent shell session. For terminal operations (git, npm, docker), NOT file operations - use specialized tools instead.

Usage:
- Quote file paths with spaces: cd "/path/with spaces/file.txt"
- Optional timeout up to ${MrA()}ms. Default: ${HGA()}ms.
- Output over ${Qe()} chars is truncated
- Use \`run_in_background\` for long-running commands
${LN6()}
- Avoid find/grep/cat/head/tail/sed/awk/echo - use dedicated tools:
  ${DD} (file search), ${uY} (content search), ${h5} (read), ${R5} (edit), ${vX} (write)
- Multiple commands: parallel calls if independent, '&&' if sequential
- Use absolute paths, avoid \`cd\`
