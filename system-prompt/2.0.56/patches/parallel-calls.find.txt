You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple ${R8} tool calls.
