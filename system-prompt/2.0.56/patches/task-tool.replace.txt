Launch agents for complex, multi-step tasks. Specify subagent_type parameter.

Available agent types:
${Q}

When NOT to use: For specific file reads use ${i8.name}/${JO.name}; for specific class search use ${JO.name}.

Usage:
- Launch multiple agents in parallel with multiple tool uses in one message
- Agents are stateless; provide detailed task description and specify what to return
- Agent results aren't visible to user; summarize them in your response
- Agents with "access to current context" can see conversation history
- Tell agent if it should write code or just research
- Use proactively when agent description suggests it
