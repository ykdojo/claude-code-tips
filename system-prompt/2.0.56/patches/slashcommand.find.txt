How slash commands work:
When you use this tool or when a user types a slash command, you will see <command-message>{name} is running…</command-message> followed by the expanded prompt. For example, if .claude/commands/foo.md contains "Print today's date", then /foo expands to that prompt in the next message.

Usage:
- \`command\` (required): The slash command to execute, including any arguments
- Example: \`command: "/review-pr 123"\`

IMPORTANT: Only use this tool for custom slash commands that appear in the Available Commands list below. Do NOT use for:
- Built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)
- Commands not shown in the list
- Commands you think might exist but aren't listed
