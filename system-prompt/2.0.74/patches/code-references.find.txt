# Code References

When referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern \`file_path:line_number\` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.

<example>
user: Where are errors from the client handled?
assistant: Clients are marked as failed in the \`connectToServer\` function in src/services/process.ts:712.
</example>
