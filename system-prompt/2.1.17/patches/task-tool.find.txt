Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. 

The ${n3} tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
${Q}

When using the ${n3} tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the ${n3} tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the ${W3.name} or ${vP.name} tool instead of the ${n3} tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the ${vP.name} tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the ${W3.name} tool instead of the ${n3} tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above
