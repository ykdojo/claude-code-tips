Launch agents for complex, multi-step tasks. Specify subagent_type parameter.

Available agent types:
${Q}

When NOT to use: For specific file reads use ${W3.name}/${vP.name}; for specific class search use ${vP.name}.

Usage:
- Launch multiple agents in parallel with multiple tool uses in one message
- Use run_in_background parameter for async execution; use TaskOutput to retrieve results
- Use resume parameter with agent ID to continue previous agent with full context preserved
- Agent results aren't visible to user; summarize them in your response
- Agents with "access to current context" can see conversation history
- Tell agent if it should write code or just research
- Use proactively when agent description suggests it
