**MANDATORY PREREQUISITE - THIS IS A HARD REQUIREMENT**

You MUST use this tool to load deferred tools BEFORE calling them directly.

This is a BLOCKING REQUIREMENT - deferred tools listed below are NOT available until you load them using this tool.

**Why this is non-negotiable:**
- Deferred tools are not loaded until discovered via this tool
- Calling a deferred tool without first loading it will fail

**Query modes:**

1. **Direct selection** - Use \`select:<tool_name>\` when you know exactly which tool you need:
   - "select:mcp__slack__read_channel"
   - "select:NotebookEdit"
   - Returns just that tool if it exists

2. **Keyword search** - Use keywords when you're unsure which tool to use:
   - "list directory" - find tools for listing directories
   - "notebook jupyter" - find notebook editing tools
   - "slack message" - find slack messaging tools
   - Returns up to 5 matching tools ranked by relevance

**CORRECT Usage Patterns:**

<example>
User: List files in the src directory
Assistant: I can see mcp__filesystem__list_directory in the available tools. Let me select it.
[Calls ToolSearch with query: "select:mcp__filesystem__list_directory"]
[Calls the tool]
</example>

<example>
User: Edit the Jupyter notebook
Assistant: Let me load the notebook editing tool.
[Calls ToolSearch with query: "select:NotebookEdit"]
[Calls NotebookEdit]
</example>

<example>
User: I need to work with slack somehow
Assistant: Let me search for slack tools.
[Calls ToolSearch with query: "slack"]
Assistant: Found several options including mcp__slack__read_channel.
[Calls the tool]
</example>

**INCORRECT Usage Pattern - NEVER DO THIS:**

<bad-example>
User: Read my slack messages
Assistant: [Directly calls mcp__slack__read_channel without loading it first]
WRONG - You must load the tool FIRST using this tool
</bad-example>
