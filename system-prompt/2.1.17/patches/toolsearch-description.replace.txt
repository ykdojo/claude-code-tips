**REQUIRED:** You MUST load deferred tools via this tool BEFORE calling them directly.

**Query modes:**
1. **Direct selection** - \`select:mcp__slack__read_channel\` when you know the tool
2. **Keyword search** - "slack message" to find matching tools

<example>
User: List files in src
Assistant: [Calls ToolSearch with query: "select:mcp__filesystem__list_directory"]
[Then calls the tool]
</example>

NEVER call deferred tools without loading them first.
