# 30 Claude Code Tips: From Basics to Advanced

## Tip 1: Talk to Claude with your voice

I found that you can communicate much faster with your voice than typing with your hands. Using a voice transcription system on your local machine is really helpful for this.

On my Mac, I've tried a few different options:
- [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/)
- [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper)
- [Super Voice Assistant](https://github.com/ykdojo/super-voice-assistant)

You can get more accuracy by using a hosted service, but I found that a local model is strong enough for this purpose. Even when there are mistakes or typos in the transcription, Claude is smart enough to understand what you're trying to say. Sometimes you need to say certain things extra clearly, but overall local models work well enough.

## Tip 2: AI context is like milk; best served fresh and condensed

When you start a new conversation with Claude Code, it performs the best because it doesn't have all the added complexity of having to process the previous context from earlier parts of the conversation. But as you talk to it longer and longer, the context gets longer and the performance tends to go down.

So it's best to start a new conversation for every new topic, or if the performance starts to go down.
